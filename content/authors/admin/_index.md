Microbes are the most diverse organisms on earth; however, we know little about them; the mechanisms that generate all this diversity,  how they live, and how they interact with the environment are some of the questions that remain open.

As a postdoctoral fellow at the Baker Lab,  I study the uncultured microbes that live in the hydrothermal vents and other habitats like oil spills.  The main questions that I am trying to answer are, Who lives there? What do they eat to get energy? Moreover, how do they interact with each other? 

My interest in bioinformatics and genomics took me to my first postdoc at INECOL.  Here I studied a phytopathogenic fungus at the Mexican-US border, which was destroying forests. I design a method to identify this pathogen; taking advantage of the pan-genome paradigm, I identify some unique genome features that allow us to accomplish the task. 

I did my Ph.D. at the Ecology Institute at the UNAM in México City. During this time, I studied the landscape genomics of a rare lineage of Vibrionaceae isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, looking for the genes that could explain this ultra-oligotrophic adaptation environment.

I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge, and I love the R community. I start using R when I became part of the CDSB and Rladies community and then a co-organizer of RLadies Xalapa, a safe place for minorities to learn how to code.
