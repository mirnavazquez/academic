I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Baker Lab at The University of Texas at Austin, where I study uncultured microbes through metagenomics. Most of these weird life forms were identified on samples from hydrotermal vents and other habitats like oil spills. The questions in which I am currently interested are how do they survive? Which means, what do they eat to get energy from the metabolic perspective? As well, I am trying to understand, based on each genes, how do they interact with other members of the comunity?   

During my previous postdoc at INECOL I took advantage of the pan-genome paradigm to design a diagnostic system to aqurately identify a pathogen fungi that attack the trees in the Mexican-US border. 

I studied my Ph.D. at the Ecology Institute at the UNAM in México City. During this time, I studied the landscape genomics of a rare lineage of Vibrionaceae isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, looking for the genes that could explain the adaptation to these ultraoligotrophic environment. 

I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge, and I love the R community. I start using R when I became part of the CDSB and Rladies community and then a co-organizer of RLadies Xalapa, a safe place for minorities to learn how to code.
